# allen-password-generator

This week's challenge consisted of starter code being distributed and us students turning said code into a functional, interactive website that generates a password at random using prompts given to the user, and the user's responses to said prompts. This challenge required several changes to be made to the JavaScript, ensuring the site to have the proper questions displayed and the user's inputs taken into account when generating the password. 

Assistance with challenge was given by TAs of Bootcamp program, as well as tutor Bobbi Tarkany.
